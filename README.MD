1. How to change the Wireless Network Configuration on the running Board
      

    • Edit this file with the needed SSID and KEY
      /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf:
country=DE
network={
    ssid="SSID"
    proto=WPA2
    psk="KEY"
}
    • Now a connection can be established with a reboot, or:
target$ wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211 -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf -iwlan0 &

2. How to add the 8192eu based Wifi-USB-Stick into a fresh Yocto BSP:


To build your own BSP choose a directory: (mkdir example) (cd example)

	wget ftp://ftp.phytec.de/pub/Software/Linux/Yocto/Tools/phyLinux
	chmod +x phyLinux 
	./phyLinux init
	. sources/poky/oe-init-build-env
choose a image to build (here for eg. Phytec-headless-image):
	bitbake phytec-headless-image

In a fresh BSP: 

2.1 copy the /meta-rtl8192eu tree (from USB-Stick/Source/ to:
              /sources/


	
2.2 go to:
	/build/conf$  
	vi bblayers.conf

add below :BBLAYERS += "\
	
	${OEROOT}/../meta-rtl8192eu \

2.3 If you like to add Wlan-ID and passkey do the following steps else skip it:
go to:
	sources/poky/meta/meta-rtl8192eu/recipes-bsp/drivers/files
	vi wpa_supplicant-wlan0.conf
add your desired wlan-ID and passkey:

	update_config=1

	network={
  	      ssid="MYSSID"
	      psk="MY-SECURE-PASSKEY"
	      proto=RSN
    	      key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
                      }
2.4 sometimes before bitbake you got to source the sources with:
	. sources/poky/oe-init-build-env
build again:
	bitbake -c compile virtual/kernel -–force
	bitbake phytec-headless-image --force
